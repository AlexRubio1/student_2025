> **The beginning of my coding journey**

The start of my journey was a little intense has I didn't know what I was for a little bit until the teacher and my dad helped me. Going on I started to try and use python to code possibly and animation or anything. Starting with this homepage I'm going to try and make it entertaining.

More about myself is that I love playing football and that it's my passion. I wanted to start to learn coding because of my dad and video games. I saw by how the graphics and everything made me intruged and how I can do that to other people too and how I could increase my knowledge.




<style>
    /* Style looks pretty compact, trace grid-container and grid-item in the code */
    .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr)); /* Dynamic columns */
        gap: 10px;
    }
    .grid-item {
        text-align: center;
    }
    .grid-item img {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100px; /* Fixed height for uniformity */
        object-fit: contain; /* Ensure the image fits within the fixed height */
    }
    .grid-item p {
        margin: 5px 0; /* Add some margin for spacing */
    }
</style>

</div>

    // 1. Make a connection to the HTML container defined in the HTML div
